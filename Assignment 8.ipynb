It progresses level by level and moves downwards only from the best W nodes at each level. Beam Search uses breadth-first search to build its search tree. Beam Search constructs its search tree using breadth-first search. It generates all the successors of the current level’s state at each level of the tree. However, at each level, it only evaluates a W number of states. Other nodes are not taken into account. \n",
    "The heuristic cost associated with the node is used to choose the best nodes. The width of the beam search is denoted by W. If B is the branching factor, at every depth, there will always be W × B nodes under consideration, but only W will be chosen. More states are trimmed when the beam width is reduced. "
